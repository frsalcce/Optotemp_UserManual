# Walkthrough

### The Main screen
![Sensor viewer main screen](https://github.com/frsalcce/Optotemp_UserManual/blob/main/pictures/sensorviewer/Sensorviewer_results.png)

On the bottom left you'll see the device status.

The Start button will start taking a live reading of the spectrum every Update Period. By default, the update period is 250ms, or 4 times a second. You can configure the Update Period using the dropdown on the left. The live readout will be displayed on the graph.

---

### Settings
![Settings screen](https://github.com/frsalcce/Optotemp_UserManual/blob/main/pictures/sensorviewer/Sensorviewer_settings.png)

By default, the Optotemp is selected and should auto-initialize. If it doesn't automatically initialize the device, you may need to use the ReInit button. If the ReInit button doesn't work you can try restarting the software.

### Usage

![results graph](https://github.com/frsalcce/Optotemp_UserManual/blob/main/pictures/sensorviewer/Sensorviewer_results_graph.png)

Once you press the start button and you begin recording you will see a graph reading ~760 for baseline. Currently this is the peak of the recieved wavelength. It will increase as tempurature increases.

![settings graph](https://github.com/frsalcce/Optotemp_UserManual/blob/main/pictures/sensorviewer/Sensorviewer_settings_graph.png)

 On the settings page you wil see a graph of the recieved wavelength and it's peak. You can also change The settings at the top; Exposure, Weight, and Averages to get more refined results.
